    personal identity and is not stored by the app.
  </p>

  <h2>No Accounts or Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    Spoonwise does not require user accounts and does not use
    analytics, advertising identifiers, or tracking technologies.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Recipe suggestions are retrieved from external recipe providers.
    Requests may include ingredient keywords, but no personal or
    identifying information is transmitted.
  </p>

  <h2>Offline Use</h2>
  <p>
    Some features may work offline using cached data stored locally on
    the device. Cached data is not transmitted.
